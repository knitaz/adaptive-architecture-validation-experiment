# adaptive-learning-architecture

This repository contains the supplementary materials for **adaptive architecture validation**. The materials include:

- **Expert evaluation procedure**: The steps and instructions followed during expert interaction with the physical prototype.
- **Prototype images**: Pictures of the 3D model used for the expert evaluations.
- **Evaluation instruments and results**: System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire, component-specific feedback, and expert ratings.
- **Thematic analysis and field notes**: Analysis of expert feedback and observational insights.

## How to Use the Materials

1. **Evaluation Procedure**: Follow the **focus group** approach described in the procedure to conduct similar expert evaluations or adapt the method to suit different contexts.
2. **Prototype Images**: The images can be used as references for creating your own prototypes or to visually understand the evaluation process.
3. **Evaluation Instruments and Results**: Use the SUS scores and feedback to assess the usability of your own adaptive learning architecture.
4. **Field Notes**: Use the qualitative feedback to gain insights into expert opinions, identify strengths, and areas for improvement.
