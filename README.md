# adaptive-architecture-validation-experiment
This repository contains the supplementary materials for the evaluation of an **adaptive architecture validation experiment**. These materials include the evaluation procedure, prototype images, expert feedback, SUS data, and thematic analysis.

The repository includes:
– Expert evaluation guide and procedure documentation (Procedure Expert Guide EN.docx)
- Photographs of the physical prototype (physical 3D model.jpg, Experts.png)
– Evaluation instruments and results:
• Likert-based component scores (avg scores component.png)
• Radar visualization (avg radar.png)
• Qualitative feedback (qualitative feedback comments.xlsx)
• System Usability Scale instrument and results (System Usability Scale (Adapted).xlsx, sus score.png)
– Transcribed field notes (Field notes.docx)
These materials promote transparency and reproducibility and are available
under shared academic conditions.
